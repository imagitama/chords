[Intro]
C  G  Am  F
foo (note there must be lyrics with all chords)

[Verse]
      C
Well, you done done me an' you bet I felt it.
  G
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted.
  Am
I fell right through the cracks.
        F
Now I'm trying to get back.

C                                                   G
Before the cool done run out, I'll be giving it my bestest,
                       Am
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention.
                                      F
I reckon it's again my turn
                     D7/F#
To win some or learn some.

[Chorus]
    C           G               Am
But I won't hesitate no more, no more.
          F           C
It cannot wait, I'm yours.
    G        Am
Mm, mm, hmm, mm...
                       F
Hey, hey-ey, hey, hey, hey...

[Verse]
C                                    G
Well, open up your mind and see like me.
                                     Am
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free.
                                     F
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.
